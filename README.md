# Battleship

This project is a digital implementation of the classic game 'Battleship,' showcasing skills in Test Driven Development (TDD), modular code organization, effective DOM manipulation, and strategic game logic.

## Project Overview
The project entails an interactive single-player Battleship game where players take turns attacking by strategically placing ships on a grid. The game is organized using modules and factories, and the UI is seamlessly updated through DOM manipulation. Win conditions and ship placement verification are meticulously implemented, resulting in a fully immersive gameplay experience.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates skills in:

- Utilizing Test Driven Development (TDD) methodologies for robust code.
- Organizing code effectively using modular structures and factories.
- Manipulating the DOM to provide a user-friendly interface.
- Implementing intricate game logic including win conditions and ship placement.

## Future Implementations
In the future, the following features may be added:

- "Drag and Drop" for ship placement.
- Implementation of a smart AI to attack adjacent cells if a ship is hit.
- "Pass and Play" Multiplayer mode to be played on a mobile device.

This project not only brings the game of Battleship to life but also showcases our ability to tackle complex programming challenges while delivering a compelling user experience.
