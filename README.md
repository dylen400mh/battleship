# Battleship

This project is a digital implementation of the classic game 'Battleship,' showcasing skills in Test Driven Development (TDD), modular code organization, effective DOM manipulation, and strategic game logic. 

This project not only brings the game of Battleship to life but also showcases the ability to tackle complex programming challenges while delivering a compelling user experience.

## Features

- Users can click a button to randomize ship placement on the board.
- Users play against an AI (not smart) as they take turns making shots on the opposing board.
- If a ship is hit, the cells change colour and the surrounding cells are also filled, indicated which cells can still be attacked. 
- The game seamlessly ends when a player sinks all opposing ships.

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Jest
  - Webpack
